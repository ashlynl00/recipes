1. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour and salt just until combined.
1. Pour batter into prepared pan, spreading into the corners of the pan. Bake for 30 minutes. Top with rolos in a single layer and return to oven for 3-5 minutes. Using a spatula, smooth melted Rolos over the top. Place on wire rack to begin cooling.
1. In a medium saucepan, combine peanut butter, butter and milk chocolate. Heat over low and stir constantly until mixture is smooth. Fold in cereal. Spread over warm brownies and allow to cool completely.
