# Roasted Salmon With Miso Rice and Ginger-Scallion Vinaigrette

**Prep time**: 10 minutes  
**Cook time**: 30 minutes

    1/4    cup white or sweet miso
    1 1/2  cups basmati or other long-grain rice
    4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
    2      tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
    Kosher salt and black pepper
    1/4    cup low-sodium soy sauce
    1/4    cup chopped scallions, plus more for garnish
    1      tablespoon distilled white vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar
    1      tablespoon minced fresh ginger
    1      pound fresh asparagus
    Roasted sesame oil, for serving
    
1. Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a medium saucepan, whisk miso with 2 1/4 cups water until dissolved. Stir in rice and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and cook until all of the liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork (it will be a little sticky).
1. On a rimmed baking sheet, rub salmon all over with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and arrange skin-side up. Roast until fish is just opaque and cooked to medium, 8 to 10 minutes.
1. Chop asparagus into small, bite-size pieces. Add to skillet with 1/2 cup water and salt. Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and cook 1 to 3 minutes.
1. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, scallions, vinegar and ginger, and season with salt and pepper.
1. Divide miso rice and asparagus among bowls. Top with salmon, ginger-scallion vinaigrette and sesame oil.
