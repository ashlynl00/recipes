# Cold Brew Coffee

    1.5 	cups coffee beans, whole
    8   	cups cold-filtered water
            nut milk bag (for filtering, optional)

1. Grind coffee beans on a coarse setting (I like to use the same setting as french press).
2. Pour grounds into 8-cup mixing bowl.
3. Cover grounds with filtered, cold water until full.
4. Stir once or twice and cover. Store in a cool, dark area.
5. In 20 hours, filter the coffee through a nut milk bag, or other strainer, into a storage container.
6. Pour over ice and dilute 1:1 with water (or to your liking).

Coffee should last about 5-7 days in the refrigerator.
